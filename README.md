# Automated Detection of Polycystic Ovaries using Pre-trained VGG16 Model
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal disorder. It is caused by the ovaries producing an abnormal number of tiny, fluid-filled sacs called follicles. 
The release of eggs, or ovulation, may sometimes happen differently than planned. Ultrasonography (USG) scans are a useful tool for the early identification and treatment planning of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 
In this study, a deep learning method for PCOS classification was developed and evaluated using the PCOSGen dataset of USG images of ovaries provided by [Misa Hub](https://d197for5662m48.cloudfront.net/documents/publicationstatus/187615/preprint_pdf/68d601deaac6055bc25b2816fb0b2d39.pdf). The suggested work extracts important features and distinguishes between ovaries with and without PCOS using a pre-trained VGG16 model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
