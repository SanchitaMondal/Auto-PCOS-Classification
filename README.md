# Automated Detection of Polycystic Ovaries using Pre-trained VGG16 Model
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal disorder. It is caused by the ovaries producing an abnormal number of tiny, fluid-filled sacs called follicles. 
The release of eggs, or ovulation, may sometimes happen differently than planned. Ultrasonography (USG) scans are a useful tool for the early identification and treatment planning of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 
In this study, a deep learning method for PCOS cycle prediction was developed and evaluated using the PCOSGen dataset of USG images of ovaries. The suggested work extracts important features and distinguishes between ovaries with and without PCOS using a pre-trained VGG16 model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
